# Goal

This is aimed to be an absolute bare minimum program you can compile and run on an AVR micro-controller. The compiled executable will put the micro-controller into a know state and call the main function.

## Tool Chain Configuration

This will probably be the part that is most frustrainting at first. Getting your local development environment setup to where you can succesfully compile this project. I will suggest installing Rust using the
RustUp tool. This will then allow you to pin to a nightly verrsion and have the proper build backend prsent.
